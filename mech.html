    <p>
        Mechanical engineering is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics
 principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.
It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches

    <br><br>
    The mechanical engineering (ME) field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, 
    dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition 
    to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), 
    computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze 
    manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport 
    systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch 
    of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.
    <br><br>
    Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. 
    If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design 
    the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics
     might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as 
    the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the 
    frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle 
    (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine.

    <h2 id="skill" style="text-align:center">Skills Required</h2>
    <p>
        The economic development of a country and its engineering capacity has a close link. For engineers 
in any domain, it is important to stay up to date with the latest skills that organizations want to
see in their resume. Mechanical engineering is one of the popular engineering disciplines that many 
aspirants join every year. However, besides core knowledge, it is really important to know about technical 
skills for mechanical engineers to stand out before the top recruiters and being hired in a big organization.

    <p>The job market for mechanical engineers is perennial. Even the vagaries of the global economic
        crisis could not knock out the demand for these professionals in the Indian job market. Although 
        some branches of mechanical engineering went out of focus during the meltdown period, the overall 
        situation was much better as compared with other careers. On the brighter side, things are getting    
        back to normal and this evergreen career path is again gaining coin amongst career aspirants as it 
        did during the pre-meltdown years. </p>

    <p><h2 style="text-align:center">ABOUT</h1></p>
    <p>
	Chemical engineering is a multi-disciplinary branch of engineering that combines natural and experimental sciences (such as chemistry and physics), along with life sciences (such as biology, microbiology and biochemistry) plus mathematics and economics to design, develop, produce, transform, transport, operate and manage the industrial processes that turn raw materials into valuable products.
	Chemical engineers translate processes developed in the lab into practical applications for the commercial production of products and then work to maintain and improve those processes. They rely on the main foundations of engineering: math, physics, and chemistry (though biology is playing an increasing role). The main role of chemical engineers is to design and troubleshoot processes for the production of chemicals, fuels, foods, pharmaceuticals, and biologicals, just to name a few. They are most often employed by large-scale manufacturing plants to maximize productivity and product quality while minimizing costs.
	Many of the processes within chemical engineering involve chemical reactions, and the field takes cues from chemists who are looking for new ways to create products and to investigate the mechanisms within chemical reactions. Chemical engineers then translate this chemical information to formulate designs.

    <h2 id="skill" style="text-align:center">Skills Required</h2>
    <p>
	To be able to pursue a Chemical Engineering programme, candidates should possess the right set of skills to acquire success in the future. The demand in the market and the environmental conditions too varies with time so the student must keep himself updated with each and every newly invented technologies and the current needs of the people and environment apart from these essentials skills-
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>CORE SKILLS APPLIED IN NEW WAYS</b><br>A regional engineer job posted by a waste-to-energy processor illustrates the need for both technical and regulatory skills. The position requires experience in steam plant operations and the ability to monitor and optimize plant performance. The candidate is also required to coordinate with local management to ensure compliance with internal technical standards and assist with annual compliance submittals.</li><br>
      <li><b>BEYOND TECHNICAL SKILLS</b><br>Leadership, coaching, and change management abilities remain important in the 21st century, especially as engineers rise through the ranks. A recent job posting for a process safety manager is indicative, stating the position requires a professional who could “provide leadership and direction to achieve process safety excellence, ensure direct reports are supported and aligned with department vision and goals, and maintain and improve the change management process.”Some skills will always be key to job success. “Good grammar, legible writing, the ability to write prose, interpersonal skills, and presentation skills are just as important today as they were in the 1970s,” notes John Sharland, a retired chemical engineer (Bridgewater, MA).</li><br>
      <li><b>THE ROLE OF CONTINUOUS LEARNING</b><br>ndividuals need a creative mindset and the mental elasticity to invent, discover, or create something valuable for society, writes Joseph Aoun, Northeastern Univ. president, in the book Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. A key part of preparing people for the future is to give them tools that will help them adapt to change.Experienced chemical engineers must embrace lifelong learning, whether it is by attending graduate-level courses, in-house training, or online continuing education programs. “I think it’s important for chemical engineers to expand their learning in the direction they would like their career to proceed,” says Ronald Shewchuk, Director of Continuous Improvement at Air Liquide Americas (Chester Springs, PA).Although the future may appear murky, what is clear is that as chemical engineers today, we must remain curious about the evolving environment and ready to adapt to it by adding new skills to our repertoir
